        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Web Development</h3>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
            intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of
            plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
            comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
            design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network
            security configuration, and e-commerce development.

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
            content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
            developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
            related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
            collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
            kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3]

        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use
            of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.

        <hr width="96%" size="3.5" color="black">
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a
            website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic,
            application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.
